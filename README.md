# Multiple_instance_learning_lymphocytosis

Final project for the Deep Learning for Medical Imaging course from MVA master, supervised by Maria Vakalopoulou (CentraleSupelec) and Olivier Colliot(CNRS). 

**Abstract**

  *Lymphocytosis manifests as an elevation in lymphocyte levels within the bloodstream. Detecting the underlying cause of this condition involves conducting a comprehensive analysis, which includes examining blood smear images and accompanying clinical data like age and lymphocyte concentration. This approach aids in pinpointing the specific disease responsible for the observed lymphocytosis. We propose a method that melds insights from two different data sources - images and clinical attributes - using minimal computational resources for diagnosing lymphocytosis within a multi-instance learning framework. Initially, we focus on extracting image features through self-supervised learning techniques. This enables us to condense each image into a compact, low-dimensional representation.In the next phase, we integrate information derived from these image embeddings alongside clinical attributes to diagnose lymphocytosis effectively.*
